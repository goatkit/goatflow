# Static Routes Baseline - Last updated: Dec 29 2025
#
# Purpose: Prevent reintroduction of hard-coded routes. All business/API routes
# must live in YAML route files (routes/*.yaml).
#
# Migration Workflow:
# 1. Move a code route to YAML
# 2. Remove it from htmx_routes.go
# 3. Run: make build (validate_routes.sh will verify)
# 4. This baseline auto-updates on successful build
#
# Do NOT add new entries here. Only shrink this list.
#
# Current code-defined routes (47 remaining):
